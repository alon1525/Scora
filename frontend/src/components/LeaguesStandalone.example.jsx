/*
Features of the LeaguesStandalone component:

1. **Real Data Integration**:
   - Fetches user's leagues from `/api/leagues/my-leagues`
   - Gets league details and standings from `/api/leagues/{id}`
   - Shows actual user positions and points in each league

2. **Authentication**:
   - Uses your existing AuthContext
   - Handles authentication errors gracefully
   - Shows appropriate error messages

3. **Functionality**:
   - Create new leagues (calls `/api/leagues/create`)
   - Join existing leagues (calls `/api/leagues/join`)
   - Copy join codes to clipboard
   - Navigate to league leaderboards

4. **UI/UX**:
   - Dark theme matching your app's design
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Smooth animations and hover effects

5. **Navigation**:
   - Clicking on a league card navigates to `/league/{id}`
   - Uses React Router for navigation

Usage:
- Add the route in App.jsx: `<Route path="/leagues" element={<LeaguesStandalone />} />`
- Navigate to `/leagues` to see the component
- The component will automatically load the user's leagues and show their positions/points

The component is completely self-contained and handles all the data fetching,
error handling, and user interactions internally.
